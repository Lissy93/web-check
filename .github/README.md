<summary><b>IP Address</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="undefined?" align="right" />

###### Description
The IP Address task involves mapping the user provided URL to its corresponding IP address through a process known as Domain Name System (DNS) resolution. An IP address is a unique identifier given to every device on the Internet, and when paired with a domain name, it allows for accurate routing of online requests and responses.

###### Use Cases
Identifying the IP address of a domain can be incredibly valuable for OSINT purposes. This information can aid in creating a detailed map of a target's network infrastructure, pinpointing the physical location of a server, identifying the hosting service, and even discovering other domains that are hosted on the same IP address. In cybersecurity, it's also useful for tracking the sources of attacks or malicious activities.

<details>
<summary><b>SSL</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/kB7LsV1/wc-ssl.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
The SSL task involves checking if the site has a valid Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. SSL is a protocol for establishing authenticated and encrypted links between networked computers. It's commonly used for securing communications over the internet, such as web browsing sessions, email transmissions, and more. In this task, we reach out to the server and initiate a SSL handshake. If successful, we gather details about the SSL certificate presented by the server.

###### Use Cases
SSL certificates not only provide the assurance that data transmission to and from the website is secure, but they also provide valuable OSINT data. Information from an SSL certificate can include the issuing authority, the domain name, its validity period, and sometimes even organization details. This can be useful for verifying the authenticity of a website, understanding its security setup, or even for discovering associated subdomains or other services.

<summary><b>DNS Records</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/7Q1kMwM/wc-dns.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
The DNS Records task involves querying the Domain Name System (DNS) for records associated with the target domain. DNS is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to communicate. Various types of DNS records exist, including A (address), MX (mail exchange), NS (name server), CNAME (canonical name), and TXT (text), among others.

###### Use Cases
Extracting DNS records can provide a wealth of information in an OSINT investigation. For example, A and AAAA records can disclose IP addresses associated with a domain, potentially revealing the location of servers. MX records can give clues about a domain's email provider. TXT records are often used for various administrative purposes and can sometimes inadvertently leak internal information. Understanding a domain's DNS setup can also be useful in understanding how its online infrastructure is built and managed.

<summary><b>Crawl Rules</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/KwQCjPf/wc-robots.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
The Crawl Rules task is focused on retrieving and interpreting the 'robots.txt' file from the target website. This text file is part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP), a group of web standards that regulate how robots crawl the web, access and index content, and serve that content up to users. The file indicates which parts of the site the website owner doesn't want to be accessed by web crawler bots.

###### Use Cases
The 'robots.txt' file can provide valuable information for an OSINT investigation. It often discloses the directories and pages that the site owner doesn't want to be indexed, potentially because they contain sensitive information. Moreover, it might reveal the existence of otherwise hidden or unlinked directories. Additionally, understanding crawl rules may offer insights into a website's SEO strategies.

<summary><b>Associated Domains and Hostnames</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/25j1sT7/wc-hosts.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
This task involves identifying and listing all domains and subdomains (hostnames) that are associated with the website's primary domain. This process often involves DNS enumeration to discover any linked domains and hostnames.

###### Use Cases
In OSINT investigations, understanding the full scope of a target's web presence is critical. Associated domains could lead to uncovering related projects, backup sites, development/test sites, or services linked to the main site. These can sometimes provide additional information or potential security vulnerabilities. A comprehensive list of associated domains and hostnames can also give an overview of the organization's structure and online footprint.

<summary><b>Redirect Chain</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/hVVrmwh/wc-redirects.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
This task traces the sequence of HTTP redirects that occur from the original URL to the final destination URL. An HTTP redirect is a response with a status code that advises the client to go to another URL. Redirects can occur for several reasons, such as URL normalization (directing to the www version of the site), enforcing HTTPS, URL shorteners, or forwarding users to a new site location.

###### Use Cases
Understanding the redirect chain can be crucial for several reasons. From a security perspective, long or complicated redirect chains can be a sign of potential security risks, such as unencrypted redirects in the chain. Additionally, redirects can impact website performance and SEO, as each redirect introduces additional round-trip-time (RTT). For OSINT, understanding the redirect chain can help identify relationships between different domains or reveal the use of certain technologies or hosting providers.

<summary><b>TXT Records</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/wyt21QN/wc-txt-records.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
TXT records are a type of Domain Name Service (DNS) record that provides text information to sources outside your domain. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as verifying domain ownership, ensuring email security, and even preventing unauthorized changes to your website.

###### Use Cases
In the context of OSINT, TXT records can be a valuable source of information. They may reveal details about the domain's email configuration, the use of specific services like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365, or security measures in place such as SPF and DKIM. Understanding these details can give an insight into the technologies used by the organization, their email security practices, and potential vulnerabilities.

<summary><b>Open Ports</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/F8D1hmf/wc-ports.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
Open ports on a server are endpoints of communication which are available for establishing connections with clients. Each port corresponds to a specific service or protocol, such as HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 21), etc. The open ports on a server can be determined using techniques such as port scanning.

###### Use Cases
In the context of OSINT, knowing which ports are open on a server can provide valuable information about the services running on that server. This information can be useful for understanding the potential vulnerabilities of the system, or for understanding the nature of the services the server is providing. For example, a server with port 22 open (SSH) might be used for remote administration, while a server with port 443 open is serving HTTPS traffic.

<summary><b>Carbon Footprint</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/dmbFxjN/wc-carbon.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
This task calculates the estimated carbon footprint of a website. It's based on the amount of data being transferred and processed, and the energy usage of the servers that host and deliver the website. The larger the website and the more complex its features, the higher its carbon footprint is likely to be.

###### Use Cases
From an OSINT perspective, understanding a website's carbon footprint doesn't directly provide insights into its internal workings or the organization behind it. However, it can still be valuable data in broader analyses, especially in contexts where environmental impact is a consideration. For example, it can be useful for activists, researchers, or ethical hackers who are interested in the sustainability of digital infrastructure, and who want to hold organizations accountable for their environmental impact.

<summary><b>Server Info</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/Mk1jx32/wc-server.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
This task retrieves various pieces of information about the server hosting the target website. This can include the server type (e.g., Apache, Nginx), the hosting provider, the Autonomous System Number (ASN), and more. The information is usually obtained through a combination of IP address lookups and analysis of HTTP response headers.

###### Use Cases
In an OSINT context, server information can provide valuable clues about the organization behind a website. For instance, the choice of hosting provider could suggest the geographical region in which the organization operates, while the server type could hint at the technologies used by the organization. The ASN could also be used to find other domains hosted by the same organization.

<summary><b>Domain Info</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/89WLp14/wc-domain.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
This task retrieves Whois records for the target domain. Whois records are a rich source of information, including the name and contact information of the domain registrant, the domain's creation and expiration dates, the domain's nameservers, and more. The information is usually obtained through a query to a Whois database server.

###### Use Cases
In an OSINT context, Whois records can provide valuable clues about the entity behind a website. They can show when the domain was first registered and when it's set to expire, which could provide insights into the operational timeline of the entity. The contact information, though often redacted or anonymized, can sometimes lead to additional avenues of investigation. The nameservers could also be used to link together multiple domains owned by the same entity.

<summary><b>DNS Security Extensions</b></summary>

<img width="300" src="https://i.ibb.co/J54zVmQ/wc-dnssec.png?" align="right" />

###### Description
Without DNSSEC, it's possible for MITM attackers to spoof records and lead users to phishing sites. This is because the DNS system includes no built-in methods to verify that the response to the request was not forged, or that any other part of the process wasn‚Äôt interrupted by an attacker. The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) secures DNS lookups by signing your DNS records using public keys, so browsers can detect if the response has been tampered with. Another solution to this issue is DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLD).

###### Use Cases
DNSSEC information provides insight into an organization's level of cybersecurity maturity and potential vulnerabilities, particularly around DNS spoofing and cache poisoning. If no DNS secururity (DNSSEC, DoH, DoT, etc) is implemented, this may provide an entry point for an attacker.
